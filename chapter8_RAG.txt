Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines retrieval and generation. 
Instead of relying only on the model’s memory, it retrieves external knowledge. 
This reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in evidence. 
It is especially useful in chatbots, search assistants, and education.
