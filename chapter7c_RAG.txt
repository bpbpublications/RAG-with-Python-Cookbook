Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI architecture that combines a retriever with a generator.
The retriever searches a knowledge base or document store to find relevant context.
The generator then uses this context along with the user query to produce fact-grounded answers.
RAG improves accuracy by reducing hallucinations compared to standard LLM responses.
It is especially useful for answering complex or multi-part queries that require external knowledge.
