Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables 
systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
It relies on algorithms and statistical models to analyze data and make predictions. 

Deep Learning is a specialized branch of ML that uses artificial neural networks 
with multiple layers. Deep Learning excels in image recognition, speech processing, 
and natural language understanding.
