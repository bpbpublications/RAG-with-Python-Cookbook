
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to simulate human intelligence. 
It includes processes such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. 
The primary goal of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks that normally 
require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, 
decision-making, and language translation.
