Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, 
especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. 
Applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition, and computer vision.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that 
allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. ML algorithms improve 
automatically through experience. It is widely used in spam detection, recommendation engines, 
and predictive analytics.

Deep Learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with many 
layers (deep architectures). It is especially powerful for tasks like image recognition, 
natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the ability of a machine to understand, interpret, and 
generate human language. Common applications include chatbots, machine translation, and 
sentiment analysis.

Applications of Machine Learning and AI are diverse: 
- Healthcare: AI helps in disease detection, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. 
- Finance: Fraud detection, risk assessment, and automated trading. 
- Retail: Personalized recommendations, inventory management, and customer support chatbots. 
- Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars rely on AI for navigation, object detection, and decision-making.
